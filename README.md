This is a TypeScript version of [this](https://github.com/locize/react-i18next-example-app).

The `src/@types/i18next.d.ts` file also enables typesafe translations.
During development, you can run `npm run resources-for-ts`. And on runtime the translations are directly downloaded from the locize CDN.
